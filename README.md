How it works:
1. The MiniMax algorithm - an algorithm that finds the best path for the maximising player assuming the minimising player takes the best path available to them
2. Alpha-beta pruning - a tree pruning method that greatly increases the efficiency of the MiniMax algorithm
3. Iterative deepening - the algorithm analyses a tree of depth 1, then depth 2 etc... until analysing the next depth is too costly. This is a cost efficient way to manage the time the algorithm takes.
